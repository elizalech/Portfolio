# Portfolio

This project was my final project for ECON 184b - Econometrics with R at Brandeis Univeristy. Here at I used a random sample of housing transaction data from the state of NY between the years 1993 and 2020 to conduct an analysis of housing prices in future flood zones in NYC.
In this folder you will find the Geodatabase of flood layer zones taken from the NYC gov data repository (Bytes of the Big apple) and the housing transaction sample data. 

Contents: 
Spatial analysis code,
RMD file for project,
HTML rMarkdown output file,
Images showing all houses in flood zones at different sea level rise predictions.
